# This file lists the core packages needed to run the application.
# To set up your environment, follow these steps:
# 1. (If it exists) Delete the 'venv' folder.
# 2. Create a new virtual environment: python -m venv venv
# 3. Activate it: .\\venv\\Scripts\\activate
# 4. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
# -------------------------------------------------

# -- Core Application Framework --
flask         # Web server framework for creating the API endpoints.
pyyaml        # Used for loading the application configuration from config.yaml.

# -- Vanna.AI NL2SQL Engine --
# The central library for handling Natural Language to SQL conversion,
# RAG, and vector database interactions. Installing 'vanna' will automatically
# pull in its required dependencies like 'chromadb', 'pandas', etc.,
# ensuring compatible versions are used. This is key to fixing the environment issues.
vanna
openai                  # Required by the Qianwen (Alibaba) LLM backend used by Vanna.
chromadb                # The vector database used for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

# -- Database Connectivity --
# Add or remove connectors based on the databases you need to support.
pyodbc                  # For connecting to Microsoft SQL Server.
mysql-connector-python  # For connecting to MySQL databases.

# -- API Interaction --
requests                # For making HTTP requests, often a dependency but good to have explicitly.

# -- Text Processing --
thefuzz                 # For fuzzy string matching in location name resolution.

# -- Machine Learning --
scikit-learn            # For vector similarity calculations in intent classification.
numpy                   # For numerical operations in vector calculations.
